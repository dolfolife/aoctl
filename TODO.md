## Ideas
- [ ] The session can be fetched from the website? Similar CLI use a webhook to fetch the session.
- [ ] Support more than GoLang (e.g. TS)

## Init
- [ ] *open question*: Should we initilize all the files from the years 2015 to present? 

## Puzzle
- [ ] Save puzzle information at the right location on the Advent of Code folder

## Test
- [ ] Tell the user if the test inputed is possible by checking the files needed
